# Sentinel

## Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to set up your development environment:
1. **Clone the Repository**

    First, clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository/sentinel.git
    cd sentinel
    ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

     Before installing the dependencies, it's recommended to create a virtual environment. This keeps your dependencies isolated from other projects. Use the following command to create a virtual environment named venv:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     ```
3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

     Activate the virtual environment with the following command:
     - **On Windows:**
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
     - **On Unix or MacOS:**
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
4. **Install Requirements**

     With the virtual environment activated, install the project dependencies using:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Running the Project
